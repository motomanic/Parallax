            <p>
                When Sarah moved into her grandmother's old house, she felt a strange mix of nostalgia and unease. <br> The house was filled with memories, but whispers seemed to linger in the corners, especially from the attic. <br> Skeptical yet curious, she decided to investigate one stormy night. The attic door creaked open, revealing <br> a dim space filled with dust and cobwebs. In the corner, a trunk caught her eye. <br>

                As she opened it, she discovered letters dating back to the 1940s, filled with love and loss. One letter, in particular, <br>spoke of a young woman who had been heartbroken and tragically lost her life in the house. That night, Sarah heard <br> the whispers again, but this time they were clearer, filled with sorrow. The spirit revealed her tragic story, and <br>together they worked to uncover the truth, allowing the ghost to finally find peace.
